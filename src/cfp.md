# Sponsor Call for Proposals (CFP)
---

Readers of this book are likely interested in **software careers** and/or **security products**.
This is a **discovery problem** with two stakeholders:

1. **Engineers** looking for exciting teams to join.

2. **Companies** looking to get quality tools in the hands of security-savvy engineers.

The primary goal of this book is **free education**.
But we'd also love to connect those stakeholders - should both parties stand to benefit.

## What we are asking

* That your company meet **two criteria**:

  1. Employer with technical roles (software development, security engineering, technical writing, product management, etc)

  2. Offers a security-relevant product (SaaS, hardware, reports, etc) or professional service (consulting, training, R&D, etc)

* **A one-time donation** to sponsor the development of this book.

  * Likely a tiny sum relative to your current marketing budget.

  * You'd be supporting a freely available resource for continuing education.

* A **brief proposal** for a written section.

  * See below.

## What we can offer

* Your **logo listed as a sponsor** on the landing page of this book, with two links of your choosing (your careers page, your product page, etc).

  * Logos will appear in order of sponsorship start date (first to latest).

  * Logo placement for the lifetime of this domain (guaranteed 10+ years).

  * You can request removal of your logo/links at any time, for any reason (e.g. future chapter of the book doesn't meet your values or quality standards).

* A **written section** in a dedicated sponsor chapter at the end of the book.

  * Tutorial of product use, article on team culture, etc.

  * Up to 3,500 words, written by you (the experts on the topic).

  * **No tracking/analytics allowed** (respect reader privacy, like an old-school magazine ad). No reader information can be collected or shared.

    * The star count on this book's repos already serves as a *transparent* and *voluntary* metric of visibility.

If you'd like to become a sponsor, please send your brief proposal (plaintext or PDF preferred) to:

<a href="mailto:contact@highassurance.rs?subject=Sponsorship_Proposal">**contact@highassurance.rs**</a>

We'd love to hear from you!

> We reserve the right to politely decline sponsorship requests for any reason (e.g. brand reputation, proposal topic, etc). We must do right by our readers.
