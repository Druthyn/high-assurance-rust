# Appendix
---

The appendix's supplemental content is categorized as follows:

* **Setup** sections detail development environment configuration and usage.

* **Inventory** sections catalog resources. Like tools covered and other books recommended.

* **Foundations** sections provide brief, optional introductions to key concepts. To accommodate readers of different backgrounds.

* **Misc** (miscellaneous) sections cover topics that, while important, don't fit naturally within the arc of the book.

Appendix sections aren't just a tack-on - they're written with the same care and effort as the main chapters.
