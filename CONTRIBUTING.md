# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to *High Assurance Rust*!

Your efforts make the book better for all other readers and are greatly appreciated.

## Contributions We Accept

* **Grammar, Spelling, Capitalization, or Punctuation Errors:** Anything objectively wrong in the English language.

    * Please open a [Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with the fix.

* **Factual or Technical Errors:** Anything provably incorrect. A counterexample or citation is recommended, but not required.

    * Please open an [Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) explaining the error found.

## Contributions We Cannot Accept

Anything outside of the above, including: rewording for style or clarity, new content, removal of existing content, etc.

These kinds of changes tend to be subjective and require back-and-forth collaboration to reach consensus.
We'd like to maintain a consistent voice.

If you'd like to suggest a significant revision or have any questions about contributing not answered by this guide, please reach out via email:

<a href="mailto:contact@highassurance.rs">**contact@highassurance.rs**</a>

## Files to Change for a PR

Please only modify `.md` files or `.rs` files.
We'll generate the book using a local copy of the [`mdbook`](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) binary.
This eliminates the need to review large diffs which may include JavaScript code.

## Adding Yourself to the Community Contributors List

If this is your first PR, please add your GitHub username/URL to the "Community Contributors" list here(TODO: LINK!).
Be sure to maintain alphabetical order.

If you open an Issue and a fix or update is made, you can open a subsequent PR adding yourself to the list and referencing the relevant issue.

## Building and Reading the Book Locally

Setup [`mdbook`](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html) (assumes you've already installed Rust per [these instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)):

```
cargo install mdbook
```

If you're on Linux, you can leverage the `Makefile` provided in this repo.
The supported `make` targets are below.

Preview book (starts webserver listening on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), will attempt to open in default browser):

```
make read
```

Check progress (runs lints and does a page count):

```
make check
```

Clean (remove any artifacts generated by the above commands):

> **An Aside on Writing**
>
> If you're ever considering writing your own content, we say go for it!
> Blog posts are a great way to start, and you can always rework the contents into a book if appropriate.
> We believe that:
>
> 1. Writing can help you refine ideas and deepen understanding, even if you never make it public.
>
> 2. No matter what level you're at, there's always someone out there that's looking to reach your level and could benefit from your experience.
>
> Static site generators like [`zola`](https://www.getzola.org/) and [`mdbook`](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) make it easier than ever to get up and running.
> [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) makes hosting hassle-free (supports custom domains and rotates SSL certs for you).
> No time like the present :)
