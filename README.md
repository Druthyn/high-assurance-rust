#### What does this book aim to do?

1. Provide an accessible but principled introduction to developing secure and robust systems. At the overlap of "state-of-the-art" and "near-term practical": mostly production-grade tools and techniques, but also some-cutting edge research projects. All open-source.

2. Help experienced developers both learn a new language and delve deeper into fundamental Computer Science and Computer Architecture topics.

#### Where's the `mdbook` source?

*High Assurance Rust* is a work-in-progress.
Once it's closer to being finished, source for the full text will be added to this repo - you'll be able to build and read the full book locally.
Currently, this repo is a placeholder with a subset of the code snippets used in the text and a `Dockerfile` for following along with each chapter.
