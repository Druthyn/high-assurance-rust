#### What does this book aim to do?

1. Provide an accessible but principled introduction to developing secure and robust systems. At the overlap of "state-of-the-art" and "near-term practical": mostly production-grade tools and techniques, but also some-cutting edge research projects. All open-source.

2. Help experienced developers both learn a new language and delve deeper into fundamental Computer Science and Computer Architecture topics.
